        <![CDATA[

<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1> <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                    therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
                    app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
                    source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
                    derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
                    property rights related to it, still belong to Boson 42 Technologies.</p> <p>Boson 42 Technologies is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
                    that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
                    and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
                    to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p> <p>The in2nemesis app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                    our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
                    recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
                    and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
                    to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
                    the in2nemesis app won’t work properly or at all. </p> <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Boson 42 Technologies will not take responsibility
                    for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
                    can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Boson 42 Technologies cannot take responsibility
                    for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
                    of your data allowance left.
                    </p><p></p><p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                        agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                        your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                        app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
                        charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
                        or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
                        you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
                        payer for using the app.</p> <p>Along the same lines, Boson 42 Technologies cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
                        the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
                        you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Boson 42 Technologies cannot accept responsibility.</p> <p>With respect to Boson 42 Technologies’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
                        the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                        correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
                        it available to you. Boson 42 Technologies accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                        you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p> <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
                        requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
                        of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
                        app. Boson 42 Technologies does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
                        to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However,
                        you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
                        stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                        to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
                        you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
                        device.
                      </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p> We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised
                        to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any
                        changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately
                        after they are posted on this page.

                        to contact us.
